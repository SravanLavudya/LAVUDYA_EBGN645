Quartz replacement in Pilot Shale closely follows the contact between ore and waste, whereas in Devils Gate Limestone, a stratiform jasperoid replacement body extends well beyond the ore zones. Beyond the area of silicification, diagenetic dolomite in Pilot Shale was replaced by hydrothermal calcite, and calcite veins comprised as much as 10% of the host rocks. Following gold deposition, intense oxidation destroyed organic matter, sulfides, and detrital illite in Pilot Shale and alunite and/or barite veins were deposited; this event is thought to be hydrothermal. Lastly, oxidation related to weathering deposited jarosite and goethite.

This conformable sedimentary contact was the focus for lateral movement of hydrothermal fluids. The upper 100 feet of the pilot shale is a less permeable claystone and may have capped hydrothermal fluids.  Structural controls: the Vantage fault served as a conduit for rising hydrothermal fluids. There is also evidence of a north-northeast striking asymmetrical anticline running the length of the deposits. The axis of the anticline would lie along the strike of the three vantage deposits and plunges gently to the southwest. Along the crest of the anticline numerous extensional fractures and extensive brecciation may have provided conduits for the ore-bearing solutions.,"Schruben, Paul G., LaPointe, D.

The Gold Quarry Main ore zone occurs at the intersection of two such faults: the Gold Quarry fault which strikes N40E, dips 75 SE and the Good Hope fault system which strikes N40W, dips steeply SW. The 90 degree intersection of these two faults was marked by a prominent outcrop of jasperoid breccia. The outcrop was sheared, brecciated, and contained open-space, silica-coated fractures. Many smaller faults which parallel the Good Hope and Gold Quarry trends occur within the deposit, creating a pervasive fracture system. This fracture system controls gold deposition at all scales from preferential localization along faults up to 15 ft. Wide to microfractures 50 microns apart. The Deep West orebody is controlled by the sedimentary/structural contact between footwall carbonate rocks and hanging wall siliciclastic rocks. The primary feeder conduit for mineralizing fluids is a steeply-dipping breccia pipe formed at the intersection of the Grey/Challenger structural system and the NW-striking Hangfire fault. Fissures, fractures zones, faulting,  folding all controlled ore deposition.
